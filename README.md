# Calculator
Final project of Foundations Course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

There are some things, that doesn't work as I would like to.

1) You can have only one decimal number (otherwise the math doesn't add up).
2) Decimals get rounded down on two numbers behind decimal point.
3) You can't work with too big numbers, because of display overflow reasons.
4) I was too lazy to do keyboard support.
5) Cleaner code would be nice. But I was working way too long on it and started to dislike working on it.

You can see it live [here](https://sharpicek.github.io/calculator/)!
